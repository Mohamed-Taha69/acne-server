# Acne Server

Acne Server is a backend API designed to support acne-related applications, such as skincare apps or dermatology platforms. Built entirely in Python, this server offers robust endpoints for managing user data, acne tracking, and recommending skincare routines. The project is ideal for developers seeking a reliable foundation for health-tech solutions centered around skin health.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Acne Tracking**: APIs for logging daily acne incidents, severity, and affected areas.
- **Skincare Recommendations**: Endpoint for personalized skincare and treatment suggestions.
- **Progress Visualization**: Support for progress charts, reports, and analytics.
- **RESTful Design**: Easy integration with web and mobile clients.
- **Extensible & Modular**: Built with extensibility in mind; add models and endpoints as needed.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python (100%)
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Likely uses FastAPI, Flask, or Django (update as appropriate)
- **Data Storage**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or other DB (update if known)
- **Authentication**: JWT or OAuth2 (specify as implemented)
- **Testing**: Pytest or Unittest

## Getting Started
